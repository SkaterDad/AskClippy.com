# WTH is going on here

Microsoft recently [announced a new version of Bing with GPT](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/7/23587454/microsoft-bing-edge-chatgpt-ai).  Sounds awesome, but what a missed opportunity!

Who wants to "Bing" something?

I'd much rather **Ask Clippy**!  

I hope I'm not the only old fart who remembers Ask Jeeves...
